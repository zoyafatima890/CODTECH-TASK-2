# **OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**

## PROJECT: **SIMPLE CALCULATOR**

### **Objective**  
The objective of the Simple Calculator project is to create a user-friendly Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations. It is designed to help users efficiently calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in an interactive and error-free environment.



### **Key Features**  
1. **Arithmetic Operations**:  
   - Addition (+)  
   - Subtraction (-)  
   - Multiplication (*)  
   - Division (/)

2. **Error Handling**:  
   - Handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).  
   - Prevents division by zero with a clear error message.

3. **Interactive Interface**:  
   - Displays a menu of operations for easy navigation.  
   - Allows users to perform multiple calculations in a single session.  

4. **Exit Option**:  
   - Provides a clean exit from the program with a farewell message.



### **Technical Details**
1. **Language Used**: Python  
   - The program is implemented in Python, leveraging its simplicity and readability for beginners.

2. **Core Concepts Utilized**:  
   - Input validation using `try-except` blocks.  
   - Loops (`while`) for continuous user interaction.  
   - Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`) for operation selection.  

3. **Code Structure**:  
   - Modular design with clearly defined blocks for operation selection, user input, and result display.  

4. **Scalability**:  
   - Designed with a structure that can be easily extended to include advanced operations like exponentiation, modulus, or trigonometric calculations.



### **Use Cases**  
1. **Educational Tool**:  
   - Suitable for beginners learning arithmetic operations and programming basics.  

2. **Everyday Calculations**:  
   - Provides a quick and reliable solution for basic mathematical operations.  



### **Key Features and Example Outputs**

#### **1. Welcome Message**  
The program greets the user and provides a list of operations.  

**Output:**  
```
Welcome to the Simple Calculator!
```

---

#### **2. List of Operations**  
The calculator displays available operations after each calculation or at the beginning.  

**Output:**  
```
Select an operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Exit
```

---

#### **3. Addition**  
Performs addition when the user selects option 1.  

**Input:**  
```
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4/5): 1
Enter the first number: 12.5
Enter the second number: 7.5
```

**Output:**  
```
Result: 12.5 + 7.5 = 20.0
```

---

#### **4. Subtraction**  
Performs subtraction when the user selects option 2.  

**Input:**  
```
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4/5): 2
Enter the first number: 20
Enter the second number: 5
```

**Output:**  
```
Result: 20.0 - 5.0 = 15.0
```

---

#### **5. Multiplication**  
Performs multiplication when the user selects option 3.  

**Input:**  
```
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4/5): 3
Enter the first number: 3
Enter the second number: 6
```

**Output:**  
```
Result: 3.0 * 6.0 = 18.0
```

---

#### **6. Division**  
Performs division when the user selects option 4.  

**Input:**  
```
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4/5): 4
Enter the first number: 15
Enter the second number: 3
```

**Output:**  
```
Result: 15.0 / 3.0 = 5.0
```

**Input (Division by zero):**  
```
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4/5): 4
Enter the first number: 15
Enter the second number: 0
```

**Output:**  
```
Error: Division by zero is not allowed.
```

---

#### **7. Invalid Inputs**  
Handles invalid inputs gracefully, ensuring the user enters valid numbers.  

**Input (Invalid choice):**  
```
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4/5): 6
```

**Output:**  
```
Invalid choice. Please select a valid operation.
```

**Input (Non-numeric input):**  
```
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4/5): 1
Enter the first number: five
```

**Output:**  
```
Error: Please enter valid numbers.
```

---

#### **8. Exit Option**  
Exits the program when the user selects option 5.  

**Input:**  
```
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4/5): 5
```

**Output:**  
```
Thank you for using the calculator. Goodbye!
```
